LA/LAA: To be released

# Preprocess
We follow the z-score normalization strategy in [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) to preprocess clean and fused lobe datasets, VerSe'19 and LA/LAA dataset.

# Requirements

* pytorch 1.8.1
* torchvision 0.9.1 
* simpleitk 2.0.2
* monai 0.9.0
* medpy 0.4.0


# Usage
If you want to train the model from scratch, run the training script as following.
